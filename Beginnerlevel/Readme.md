<h1><u>PYTHON</u></h1>
<p>
  <br/>
  Programming not only the logic.it needs input, good user interface, process,system requirements, error handling for the interaction and output.<br/>


this all code are executed with err handling using try except statements,it gives the output error statement "invalid input" or "err", while user input error or other errors.
<br/>

so please refer the difference between higher two versions such as python2.x and python3.x.
